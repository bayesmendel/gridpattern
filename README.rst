``gridpattern`` plans to provide "grob" functions for use with R's grid graphics system that display various patterns.  These patterned grobs will be extracted from the awesome `ggpattern <https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggpattern>`_ package (which provides ggplot2 "geom" functions but `does not provide exported access to the underlying grobs <https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggpattern/issues/11>`_ themselves).
